<p>When i was young,i always watch Doraemon in font of TV,dreaming of having my own Doraemon who can give me lots of amazing stuffs to play.
    As time goes by,i found that i can be my own Doraemon.Using the knowledge i learnt in electric,computer and communication,i can creative different interesting stuffs by my own.<br />
    As you can see,in the pictures above,i can design my own circuit board,can make ROVs with multi-sections,and AUVs which can clean the cubes all by itself...
    The difference is Doraemon just need to search his pocket to get a wanted tool,and i need to overcome a lot difficulties to accomplish it.<br />
    But i believe every step i made towards to my goal will play its role.
    So in the future i will keep on chasing my dream,taking my skill one step further.
